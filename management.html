            <h4>Key Holding Service</h4>
            In our sales service, we will hold your hand throughout the whole
            process and ensure that the process is simple and straight forward.
            We can recommend a trusted solicitor who can deal with absolutely
            everything, including arranging a Power of Attorney in your home
            country. We can also provide recommendations for currency exchange
            companies, where you will get the best rates when transferring your
            sales proceeds from Spain. When we attend your property, we work on
            an hourly rate so you only pay when you need us.

            <h4>Property Management Service</h4>
            This service is for when you require regular visits to your holiday
            home, properties that are rented out, or where you want us to
            arrange a cleaning and laundry service for your visits. Your
            property will be visited monthly and a condition report sent to you
            afterwards. Time spent arranging any remedial work required is
            charged at an hourly rate, but your consent would be obtained prior
            to any work being undertaken, except in emergencies.
