              and expenditure, and then provide the relevant information to an

            <h4>Long Term Rental Service</h4>
            <p>
              If you are no longer visiting your property often, but want to
              maintain it as an investment, then you could consider renting it
              on a long term basis. We have a thorough understanding of the laws
              governing renting long term in Spain, so that you can make an
              informed decision on whether this option is right for you. Again,
              our service is comprehensive and in addition to dealing with the
              management of your property, we also collect the rent and utility
              payments and keep a detailed account of income and expenditure for
              you. We can also assist by providing this information to an
              accountant in Spain.
