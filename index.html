            <h2 class="text-center">Management Service</h2>
            <p>
              This is our most popular service. We will hold your keys and be
              your point of contact in Spain. Once a month we will visit your
              property and undertake a thorough inspection, following which you
              will receive a condition report by email. At your request we can
              visit more frequently, at an additional cost. If you rent out your
              property yourself, we can organise the cleaning and laundry
              services you will need.

            <p>
              If you want to rent your property commercially, then this is the
              service for you. We have a wealth of experience in this area and
              can guide you around all you need to do to comply with any rental
              and tax legislation. We can provide a service where we manage your
              property and the rentals, or we are also happy to work with your
              existing property managers and manage only the rentals.

            <p>
              This is our most basic service, where we will hold your keys and
              be your point of contact in Spain. This service is suitable for
              owners who visit their property frequently and only require us to
              be available for ad hoc visits. Within this service we will
              organise cleaning and laundry for any of your own visits. If you
              require us to organise the cleaning and laundry for multiple
              visits by friends and family, we can do this at an additional
              cost.
